# Voxel Chat

A game where people can make their own rooms (out of voxels) and hangout with
friends in a semi-interactive way. Built with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)
for the Web and native.

This project is very early in development.

## Running

```sh
# For WASM, use trunk: cargo install --locked trunk
trunk serve

# It supports native as well, but Bevy won't launch out of WSL2
cargo run
```
